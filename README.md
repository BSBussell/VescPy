# VescPy
VESC Library in Python
Some Example Programs and Testing. For Use with the XL5 Speed Controller.
For documentation the code of VescPy.py has comments explaining the class and each function.
It's not super complicated and unless you have issues it should all work fine.

*NOTE:* I stopped working on this and implemented this into [this repo](https://github.com/BHS-AV/software) so if you want to see what parts were later removed or thrown out of the window check up here.
